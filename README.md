# hello-world

Hi professor Patra,

I was told to write a bit about myself for this part of the assignment.
I'll tell you a secret skill that I have. I can click my tongue really loud.
It's never helped me in a real life situation (surprising I know). I don't remember how I found that out, wish it had an origin story. Now you know. 

P.S. 
Hopefully you found the humor in how stupid line 5-7 were. Otherwise, I
am looking like a crazy person.
